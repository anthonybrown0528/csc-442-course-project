# Goals

The goal of this project is to predict the popularity and audience satisfaction of films that are available on Netflix given characteristics of the film by analyzing the relationship between those film characteristics and the IMDb score and number of votes for the particular film.

## Subgoals

* The subgoal for this task is to analyze the relationship between a film’s IMDb score and a short summary of the film’s plot by building a predictive model where the score is the response variable and a vector representation of the film description compose the explanatory variables.
* The subgoal of this task is to analyze features that our team created during the wrangling phase and other important features that originally came with the dataset, and try to see which ones have a strong relationship with IMDb scores.
